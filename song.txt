Looks like I'm 'a do everything myself
Maybe I could use some help
But hell, you want something done right
You gotta do it yourself

Maybe life is up and down
But my life's been what to now?
I crawled up your butt from hell
And that's when things got turned around

It used to be a lie and now it feels pathetic and now I get it
What's done is done, you just leave it alone and don't regret it
Sometimes some things turn into dumb things
And that's when you put your foot down
